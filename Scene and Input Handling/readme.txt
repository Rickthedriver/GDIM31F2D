Goal: Try to relocate the princess to the yellow pentagram.

How to play: WASD for dark wizard, arrow keys for light wizard. Red pentagrams get removed by them touching the dark wizard, 
and same for blue pentagrams with the light wizard.

Push the princess to the end of the level by carefully menuevering her away from the walls toward the golden pentagram.
If you fail to do so before the timer goes out, you lose.
If the princess gets stuck on the wall and you cannot move her out, then there is a reset button to retry the level.

Code is commented with which group member did what.
Level 1 and starting code was made by Ruiheng Yuan.
Level 2, menus, and unity work done by Cameron Romeis.
UI, audio, mechanics for pentagrams and lots of code done by Keegan Najera

Thank you for playing.
